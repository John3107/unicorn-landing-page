        "description": "Turner Little offers a range of UK and Offshore Shelf Companies ready to go, as and when you need them. Historically, ‘shelf companies’ were created so that if speed was of the essence in a new business trading, or if an urgent transaction arose, a company could be taken off the shelf for the purpose. For instance, some jurisdictions require companies to have existed for a certain amount of time before they become eligible to bid on contracts."
